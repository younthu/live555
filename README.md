###  [中文](https://github.com/younthu/live555/edit/master/README_cn.md)

I forked repository from [hackeron/live555](https://github.com/hackeron/live555), a [live555MediaStream](http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/)source mirror,and added xcode 5 project support。

##### Now, you can clone, build and debug liveMediaServer with xcode.
